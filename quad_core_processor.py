"""
A computer system with a quad-core processor is handling multiple tasks. 
There are multiple processor each having 4 cores. 
Total number of tasks to be handeled is equal to the total number of cores in the system.
Every task has a fixed execution time, and each processor has a specified time after which 
its cores becomes free to take new tasks. If exactly 4 tasks are assigned to each processor and 
they all run independently on a particular processor, what is the minimum time that all tasks will be processed.
You are given with the list of available time of all processor 'P' and the list of execution time of all tasls 'T'.
1<=P[i], T[i]<=10^6
